# Vulnerabilities in Z-Stack Implementation

We have detected several vulnerabilities with Z-Fuzzer on Z-Stack 3.0.1, developed by Texas Instruments.

Here we list the detected vulnerabilities and ZCL messages to discover those crashes.

## Target

We performed test with Z-Fuzzer on TI CC2538 devices with the SmartRF06 Evaluation Board.
We compiled and programmed Z-Stack 3.0.1 source code to the device.
